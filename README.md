# 🎓 PhD Hat Project
An interactive, sensor-driven celebration hat designed for the PhD defense of our friend Patrick Langer!

For a truly entertaining graduation moment, the hat reacts to **movement**, **alcohol detection**, — creating a fun and responsive experience, a sequence of light patterns, OLED messages, and audio playback.

---

## ✨ Overview

This Arduino-based project transforms an ordinary hat into a **multi-sensory experience** with:
- 🎶 DFPlayer Mini MP3 playback  
- 💡 WS2812 (NeoPixel) LED effects  
- 🖥️ OLED Display (256x64, SSD1322)  
- ⚙️ Motion sensing via MPU6500 IMU  
- 🍷 Alcohol detection via MQ3 gas sensor  

The system runs through several **modes** (Idle, Celebration, Drunk, Fancy), automatically progressing based on sensor input.

## 🧩 Hardware Components

| Component | Model | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Microcontroller | Arduino Nano | Core control unit |
| IMU Sensor | MPU6500 (6-axis) | Detects motion and shaking |
| Alcohol Sensor | MQ-3 | Measures ethanol vapors (for “drunk” detection) |
| Audio Module | DFPlayer Mini | Plays MP3 tracks from SD card |
| Speaker | Loud speaker | Connects to DFPlayer output |
| Display | 256x64 OLED (SSD1322) | Displays text prompts and feedback |
| LED Ring | WS2812 12-pixel (NeoPixel) | Provides visual lighting effects |
| Power | 5V regulated | Shared by all modules |

## 🎭 Software Modes

### 💤 Idle Mode
- OLED: “Welcome Dr. Patrick Langer”
- LEDs: Soft white breathing
- Audio: Plays tracks **1–8** in sequence

### 💃 Celebration Mode
- OLED: “Human activity detection”
- Plays **audio 9–10**, then waits for shaking detected by MPU6500
- If shaking is detected ( Δ acceleration > threshold): OLED → “Body activity detected” + play **audio 12–14** + LED blue pulse during waiting, multicolor when detected 
- If not detected after 3 loops: still proceeds to **audio 12–14**

### 🍷 Drunk Mode
- OLED: “Alcohol detection”
- Plays **audio 15–16**
- While MQ3 senses ethanol (avgValue > calibrated threshold), display and LED react:
  - Detected → “Alcohol detected” + play **audio 18–22** + LED rolling orange/yellow → Red when detected
  - Not detected → replay **audio 17** up to 3 times, then continue

### 🎉 Fancy Mode
- OLED: “Time to Party!”
- LED: Full RGB animation (rainbow/flicker)
- Audio: Plays **tracks 23–25**

## ⚙️ Troubleshooting & Practical Notes

### 🧩 When the Arduino Sketch Fails to Upload

If sketch doesn’t upload to the Arduino Nano (or similar board), try:

1. **Select the Correct Processor**  
   - **Tools → Processor → ATmega328P**  
     Use the default one, for the Nano clones require (Old Bootloader).

2. **Explicitly Select Board and Port**  
   - **Tools → Board → Arduino Nano**  
   - **Tools → Port →** correct COM/USB port.

3. **Reset the Board Manually (if stuck)**  
   - Disconnect any external **power supply**.  
   - Briefly **short VCC and GND** to reset.  

4. **Disconnect DFPlayer RX/TX During Upload**  
   - The DFPlayer uses Serial and may block communication with the IDE.  
   - Unplug RX/TX wires before uploading, reconnect afterward.

### 🎵 DFPlayer Mini Usage Notes
1. **SD Card Compatibility**  
   - Works only with **≤ 32GB microSD** cards.  
   - **SanDisk** is known to work well.  
   - **Intenso** and other brands may fail to initialize.

2. **File System & Copying**  
   - SD card must have **at least one MP3 file**.  
   - Avoid **macOS Finder** (creates hidden `.DS_Store` files).  
     → Use **Windows** or **Linux** to copy files.

3. **Wiring Reminder**  
   - **RX (Arduino)** → **TX (DFPlayer)**  
   - **TX (Arduino)** → **RX (DFPlayer)**  
   - **VCC → 5V**, **GND → GND**

4. **Updating or Renaming Audio Files**  
   - Name MP3 / WAV files exactly as: `0001.mp3`, `0002.mp3`, `0003.mp3`, … up to `0025.mp3`, and stored in the DFPlayer’s SD card root directory.
   - Always **format the SD card** if you needs to update or rename the audios.  
   - ⚠️ The DFPlayer plays files in the **order they were written**, not by name. The safest way to copy files is **in exact order**, ONE by ONE.  
   - DO NOT use MacOS to copy files, can fail due to hidden files / folders, use Linux or MacOS.

5. **Volume and Power**  
   - High volume (>20) can distort or stop playback.  
   - Safe range: **10–20**.
